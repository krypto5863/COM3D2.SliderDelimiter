# COM3D2.SliderDelimiter

# Why
This is meant as a 2.5 replacement for a feature of MaidVoicePitch, it does several things such as letting you set custom slider limits in the config file. However, this one delimits all sliders, you can change the range multiplication in the F1 config manager or in the config file in Bepinex/config. 1.5 is the default.
